# AutoGPT Chat Integration

## Description
This project automates the process of selecting text from a UI, copying it, analyzing it using OpenAI's GPT API, and providing responses directly into the UI. It's built using Python and libraries like `pyautogui`, `pyperclip`, and `openai`.

The script simulates user interactions, processes text, and generates responses dynamically.

## Features
- Automates UI interaction to select and copy text.
- Integrates with OpenAI's GPT API for intelligent responses.
- Simulates human-like typing and clicking actions using `pyautogui`.
- Easily configurable and extensible for various use cases.
